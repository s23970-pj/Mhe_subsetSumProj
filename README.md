# Subset Sum Problem Project

## Description

The subset sum problem (SSP) is a decision problem in computer science. In its most general formulation, there is a multiset S
of integers and a target-sum T, and the question is to decide whether any subset of the integers sum to precisely T.
This project explores various optimization algorithms to solve this NP-complete problem.

## Algorithms Implemented

TBA

## Running the Project

### Requirements

- [Programming Language] (e.g., Python 3.x)
- [Required Libraries] (TBA)

### Usage

Run any of the algorithms from the command line:

```bash
TO GENERATE NEW SETS OF DATA:
python src\generate_rand_set.py --size [size of multiset] --min_value [value] --max_value [value]  //to be completed with precise information

TO RUN DESIRED ALGORITHM:
python .\src\exhaustive_search.py --input data\sample_input.txt --target 100
