# Subset Sum Problem Project

## Description

The subset sum problem (SSP) is a decision problem in computer science. In its most general formulation, there is a multiset S
of integers and a target-sum T, and the question is to decide whether any subset of the integers sum to precisely T.
This project explores various optimization algorithms to solve this NP-complete problem.

### Requirements

- [Programming Language] (e.g., Python 3.x)
- [Required Libraries] (TBA)

### Usage

Run any of the algorithms from the command line:

```bash
python hill_climbing.py --input data.txt --target 50  //to be completed with precise information
python simulated_annealing.py --input data.txt --target 50
